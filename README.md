# Diamond Grade Calculator
We created a grade calculator with clear instructions, a clean UI, and colors that contrast well in order to enhance user experience.
This improves upon existing grade calculators that are harder to understand and look more barebones.

Our purpose with this project was to provide an accessible grade calculator to students so that they may have a clear understanding of their grades and strive for higher grades. The use of a grade calculator allows students to know where to properly allocate their time to have successful study sessions because of their in-depth understanding of their gradeand how it is calculated.
